import * as journeyRepo from '../repositories/journey.repository.js';

// Resolves an optional journey for the existing NivaBupa pass-through
// endpoints and hangs it on req.journey.
//
// Optional is the whole point: /nivabupa/premium and friends were pure
// pass-throughs before journey persistence existed, and an already-deployed
// frontend build must keep working unchanged. A request with no journey
// identity behaves exactly as it did before, and its upstream call is still
// audited (api_transactions.journey_id is nullable for this reason).
//
// Identity is accepted from, in order of preference:
//   1. X-Journey-Id / X-Resume-Token headers  ← preferred
//   2. journeyId / resumeToken in the JSON body
//
// Body fields are DELETED after being read. The controllers forward req.body
// verbatim to NivaBupa, so leaving journeyId in it would send an
// undocumented field into the Reassure 3.0 premium/UW/datapush payloads —
// which the partner API is entitled to reject. Headers avoid the problem
// altogether, which is why they are preferred.
// The journey API's own endpoints take journeyId / resumeToken as legitimate
// body fields — POST /nivabupa/journey/resume is nothing but a resumeToken — so
// this middleware must not touch them.
//
// Matched on req.originalUrl rather than relying on route-mounting order,
// because app.ts mounts the SAME router twice ('/' and '/health'). A request to
// /health/nivabupa/journey/resume is offered to the '/'-mounted router first,
// and checking the full URL is immune to which mount is handling it. (In tf-api
// the middleware is additionally registered under the `/nivabupa` path prefix so
// it never runs for a tf-api route and can never strip a field from a
// non-NivaBupa request body — see routes/index.js.)
